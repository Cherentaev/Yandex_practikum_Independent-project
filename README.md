# Yandex_practikum_Independent-project
Theme: Music of Big Cities 
The question I'm working with here is: How is the music played on the way to work on Monday morning different from the music played on Wednesday or at the end of the work week? I have data from the Yandex.Music service for Moscow and St. Petersburg and I am researching what exactly and in what mode their residents listen.   

Yandex.Music is a large product with a huge amount of data for research. Teams of such services often conduct research about users to maintain interest in the product and attract new users. To retain customers and attract new ones, to make the brand more recognizable, the service team conducts audience research and publishes interesting results.

The self-guided project is a practical test of the knowledge I acquired in the introductory course of Yandex_practikum. Each section is devoted to a separate stage of data analysis with an excursion into the basics of Python.

The project is carried out in five stages:
Formulation of the problem
Retrieving data
Data preprocessing
Data analysis
Presentation of results
