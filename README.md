Study: Music of Big Cities The question I'm working with here is: How is the music played on the way to work on Monday morning different from the music played on Wednesday or at the end of the work week? I have data from the Yandex.Music service for Moscow and St. Petersburg and I am researching what exactly and in what mode their residents listen.   Yandex.Music is a large product with a huge amount of data for research. Teams of such services often conduct research about users to maintain interest in the product and attract new users. To retain customers and attract new ones, to make the brand more recognizable, the service team conducts audience research and publishes interesting results.
